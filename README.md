## FAQs

#### How to reset the database?

After running the `main.py` script, enter the option '6', and follow the instructions to reset the database.

#### Where is the Synopsis for this project?

This question will make me say an infamous quote, "Use your eyes and not your mouth, Dora!" ðŸ˜‚
Just look for `Synopsis.docx` in the root directory of this project. And yes, instead of copying it make it yourself you lazy boy/girl. (Atleast, gimme credit please :))

#### Why is this so good?

Well, it's because it's written in python and specifically by me xD. (That's a flex ofc yk?)

#### Why the heck is it giving me ImportError?

This is because you didn't read the Installation instructions. You need to install a few external modules/libraries for some specific purposes. Check the Installation section properly for more information.

#### Why you bully me?

IDK, I missed the part where that's my problem.



## Looks Familiar?
